# JavaSript Quizzes

## Description

This project uses React.js for dynamic UI, TypeScript for type-safe development, and React Router for seamless navigation. It efficiently fetches data with TanStack Query, relies on Appwrite for backend services, and applies Tailwind CSS for responsive styling. Radix UI enhances the user experience, and Vite ensures a fast and optimized development environment.
